# CP_2020_HW2

Please write a program that checks the board of a Tic-Tac-Toe game written to a CSV file. Possible cell values are: 
"x", "o" or empty
The program for a given input file located in ``main/resources/board/`` should return one of the values of the ``Result`` 
enum.

HINT: You may replace the "x" and "o" with 1 and -1 while reading the file - this will simplify your code.
